# SWISS Phase 6 â€“ Authoritative Implementation Plan

Last updated: 2025-09-03 13:25:01 (+02:00)

This document is the authoritative, non-lossy source of truth for the remainder of Phase 6. All work must trace to these tasks exactly as written.

If an item requires change, open a PR that updates this file and references the affected tasks.

---

## Objectives

- Deliver advanced devtools features for SwissJS, centered on capability visibility, runtime introspection, template debugging, production diagnostics/telemetry, a Plugin Development Kit, and an accessible template component library.
- Maintain production-grade quality: type safety, tests, performance, CI packaging/publishing, and docs.

---

## Global Constraints & Principles

- Keep security and capability boundaries explicit and enforced.
- Ensure excellent developer UX and performance.
- Prefer TypeScript, ESM, and composable architecture.
- Tests should be fast by default; opt-in for heavy integration.

## Notes

- GitHub automation for Phase 6 EPIC and sub-issues was attempted; connectivity issues blocked it. Proceeded manually per this plan.
- VSCode extension packaging and CI are complete; VSIX ready for publishing.
- EPIC B is complete; EPIC C (Language Client) is the next target as needed.

---

## How To Use This Plan

- Treat each checkbox as a trackable deliverable.
- Open an issue per task/subtask when starting work; link to this file.
- Keep this file updated in PRs to reflect reality (only after consensus).
