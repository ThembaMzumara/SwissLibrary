Welcome to the Development section. This area documents internal policies and guidance for working on the SwissJS monorepo.

- Public vs. Internal API: Defines supported public surface and import guidance.
  - See: [/development/public-vs-internal-api](./public-vs-internal-api.md)
- Artifact Policy: Enforces that no build artifacts exist in `src/` and outlines remediation.
  - See: [/development/artifact-policy](./artifact-policy.md)

Additional development topics may be added here over time.

- Plugin Development: Lifecycle, hooks, capability audit, and service registry contracts.
  - See: [/development/plugins](./plugins.md)
