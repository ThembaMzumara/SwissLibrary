# Feature: Hosting Architecture

**Branch**: `feature/hosting`  
**Status**: 🚧 Scaffolding  
**Priority**: High (Tier 1)  
**RFC**: RFC 0003 (Accepted)  
**Domains**: swiss, swiss-enterprise, swisspay

## Overview

Implement a Docker-based hosting and deployment architecture for Swiss applications, providing containerization, orchestration, and deployment strategies from development to production.

## Motivation

Based on RFC 0003 (Hosting Architecture), we need:
- Standardized containerization for Swiss apps
- Multi-stage Docker builds for optimization
- Container orchestration strategies
- Development to production deployment pipeline
- Monitoring and observability systems

## Proposed Implementation

### Phase 1: Containerization
- [ ] Create base Docker images for Swiss apps
- [ ] Implement multi-stage build strategy
- [ ] Add development and production Dockerfiles
- [ ] Create Docker Compose configurations
- [ ] Optimize image sizes and build times

### Phase 2: Orchestration
- [ ] Design Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] Create Helm charts for Swiss apps
- [ ] Implement service mesh integration
- [ ] Add auto-scaling configurations
- [ ] Create deployment automation

### Phase 3: Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Implement CI/CD integration
- [ ] Create deployment scripts
- [ ] Add environment management
- [ ] Implement blue-green deployments
- [ ] Create rollback strategies

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] Integrate logging systems
- [ ] Add metrics collection
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing
- [ ] Create health check endpoints
- [ ] Add alerting and notifications
