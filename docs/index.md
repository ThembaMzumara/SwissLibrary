# SwissJS Documentation

Welcome to the SwissJS docs. This site contains:

- Guide: Start here to build your first app
- Concepts: SwissContext, components, reactivity, capabilities, security
- Compiler: Pipeline, transformers, diagnostics, optimizer
- Core: Runtime concepts and lifecycle
- CLI: Commands and options
- Plugins: Authoring and capability provider API
- How-To: Recipes and troubleshooting
- API: Auto-generated reference per package
- Development: Policies and internal notes (public vs internal API, artifact policy)

Tip: Prefer importing from package barrels (e.g., `@swissjs/core`) to match the public API documented here.
