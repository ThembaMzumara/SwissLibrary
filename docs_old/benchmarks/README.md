# Benchmarks Folder

This folder contains benchmarking criteria, results, and scripts for SwissJS. Benchmarks are designed to ensure SwissJS meets its goals of minimalism, security, performance, extensibility, and developer experience. 

Benchmarks are run per package and for the monorepo as a whole. Results guide framework improvements and are integrated with our dev tools for real-time feedback and profiling.

See BENCHMARKS.md for detailed criteria and instructions.
