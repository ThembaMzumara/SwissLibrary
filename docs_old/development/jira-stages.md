## 1. Backlog
- **Description:** Work is captured, described, and prioritized, but not yet ready to be started.
- **Branch Context:** No branch yet; item is in planning.

## 2. In Progress
- **Description:** Actively being developed on a feature branch (branched from `develop`).
- **Branch Context:** Feature branches (e.g., `feature/xyz`) created from `develop`.

## 3. In Review
- **Description:** Code is complete and a pull request (PR) is open for review and integration into `develop` or another target branch.
- **Branch Context:** PRs targeting `develop` (or hotfixes targeting `main`).

## 4. Staging/Testing
- **Description:** Merged into `staging` for pre-production testing and verification (QA, CI, UAT, etc.).
- **Branch Context:** Code is in the `staging` branch, reflecting the next release candidate.

## 5. Done
- **Description:** Successfully released to `main` (production) or hotfix merged and deployed.
- **Branch Context:** Code is in the `main` branch (production) or hotfix completed.

### Why These Stages?
- **Backlog:** Captures all ideas and unstarted work.
- **In Progress:** Represents active development on feature branches.
- **In Review:** Ensures code quality and team alignment before merging.
- **Staging/Testing:** Reflects our "staging is king" principleâ€”work is validated before release.
- **Done:** Work is fully complete, merged to `main`, and released.

This workflow keeps our process simple, clear, and tightly aligned with our branch strategy.
