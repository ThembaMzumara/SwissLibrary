## Task Generation Formula

Use this structured approach to break down umbrella tasks into actionable items:

**Task = [Action] + [Specific Component] + [Purpose] + [Acceptance Criteria]**

### Components:

- **Action:** Create, Implement, Refactor, Test, Document, Integrate
- **Specific Component:** Core module, compiler feature, CLI command, etc.
- **Purpose:** What user need it addresses
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Measurable success metrics
