# SwissJS V2: Architecture Redesign

Based on a comprehensive critique of V1, this document outlines the redesigned V2 architecture for SwissJS. It combines the strongest elements from multiple proposals to create a robust, secure, and performant framework.

## High-Level Architecture

The V2 architecture modularizes the framework into distinct, decoupled packages with clear responsibilities and strict API boundaries.

## Key Improvements & Rationale

### 1. Optimized Runtime System
- **Factory Pattern**: Unified adapter creation via `adapter-factory.ts` centralizes runtime-specific logic, making it easier to add new runtimes like Deno.
- **Lazy Detection**: Runtime detection is deferred until absolutely necessary, reducing the framework's startup time, especially in production environments where the runtime is known.
- **Single Entry**: All runtime access is channeled through `runtime-service.ts`, providing a consistent API and preventing direct, untracked calls to runtime-specific functions.
- *Solves*: Runtime overhead, complex relationships, difficult extensibility.

### 2. Capability-Based Security System
- **Explicit Package**: A dedicated `security` package houses the core policy engine, separating security concerns from the main framework logic.
- **Gateway Pattern**: The `core` package exposes only a `PolicyGateway` interface. This prevents plugins or application code from directly manipulating the security engine, enforcing a strict API boundary.
- **Registry**: A central `CapabilityRegistry` tracks granted permissions, providing a single source of truth for security decisions.
- *Solves*: Plugin overreach, security risks, lack of clear permission model.

### 3. Unified UI Engine
- **Dedicated Package**: The VDOM, renderer, directives, hooks, and reactivity system are extracted into a dedicated `ui-engine` package. This clarifies their role and decouples rendering logic from the core framework.
- **Reactivity Integration**: Hooks are designed to leverage the reactivity system directly, creating a more intuitive and efficient state management pattern.
- **Compiler Optimization**: A dedicated `optimizer.ts` in the `compiler` package is responsible for UI-specific optimizations, such as tree-shaking components and static property hoisting.
- *Solves*: Compiler ambiguity, unclear rendering responsibilities.

### 4. Plugin Containment
- **Strict Boundaries**: Plugins can only access framework features through a capability-scoped base, preventing them from accessing unauthorized APIs.
- **Audit Trail**: The security system actively monitors plugin activities, creating an audit trail for diagnostics and security analysis.
- **Explicit Registration**: The `PluginManager` handles all registrations, ensuring that no plugin can execute without first being vetted by the security engine.
- *Solves*: Plugin overreach, security risks, untraceable side-effects.

### 5. Documentation System
- **Auto-Generated API**: The developer tools include an `api-generator` that scans source code to produce up-to-date API documentation automatically.
- **Security Manual**: A dedicated security manual explains the capability model, policies, and best practices for secure plugin development.
- **Live References**: Documentation will explicitly reference code artifacts, ensuring that a change in the code flags the corresponding documentation for review.
- *Solves*: Outdated and non-actionable documentation.

### 6. Utility Consolidation
- **Single Source**: All shared utilities are consolidated into `packages/utils`, eliminating duplication.
- **Runtime-Specific**: Utilities that depend on the runtime environment are isolated in `runtime.ts` and use the `RuntimeService`.
- **Shared Access**: These utilities are designed to be safely used across the entire monorepo.
- *Solves*: Utility duplication and inconsistent implementations.

## Critical Security Workflow

This sequence diagram illustrates how a plugin is safely registered and granted capabilities.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant P as Plugin
    participant PM as PluginManager
    participant SE as SecurityEngine
    participant CR as CapabilityRegistry
    
    P->>PM: register()
    PM->>SE: audit(plugin)
    SE->>SE: validate(capabilities)
    alt Valid
        SE->>CR: grant(capabilities)
        CR->>PM: confirmation()
        PM->>P: initialize()
    else Invalid
        SE->>PM: reject()
        PM->>P: error("Capability denied")
    end
```

## Performance Optimization

The runtime system can be initialized differently for development and production to optimize startup performance.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[CLI Command] --> B{Production Mode?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Preload Runtime Adapter]
    B -->|No| D[Lazy Runtime Detection]
    C --> E[Direct Initialization]
    D --> F[Detect on First Request]
    E & F --> G[Optimized Startup]
```

## Implementation Roadmap

This V2 migration will be executed in phases to ensure a stable and manageable transition.
